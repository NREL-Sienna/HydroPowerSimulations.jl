# Welcome to HydroPowerSimulations.jl

## About

`HydroPowerSimulations.jl` is a [`Julia`](http://www.julialang.org) package that extends [`PowerSimulations.jl`](https://nrel-sienna.github.io/PowerSimulations.jl/stable/) for modeling of hydro generation technology in operational simulations.

* * *

HydroPowerSimulations has been developed as part of the Flexible Linked Analysis of Streamflow and Hydropower (FLASH), Reliability and Resilience of coordinated water Distribution and power Distribution (R2D2) and HydroWires-C projects at the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory ([NREL](https://www.nrel.gov/)) Software Record SWR-23-110.
